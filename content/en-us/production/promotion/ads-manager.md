<Alert severity="warning">
The Ads Manager feature is in beta.
</Alert>

The **Ads Manager** offers advertisers control over their ad campaigns, empowering them to create, optimize, and measure ads effectively while reaching their campaign objectives. Advertisers can use this tool to manage their ad campaigns, ads reporting, and ads billings in one place.

With the Ads Manager, you can create campaigns for immersive ads for ad units within experiences (like [image ads](#image-ads), [video ads](#video-ads), and [portal ads](#portal-ads)), [sponsored experiences](#sponsored-experiences) that appear on the Home page, and [search ads](./search-ads.md) that appear on Search results.

## Create an ad account

To access the Ads Manager, you must create an ad account with a verified email on a Roblox account registered for users aged 13 years or older.

When creating an account, you can choose between creating a personal or business account. A personal account is for individuals who want to advertise on Roblox, while a business account manages a company's ad presence on Roblox.

To create an ad account:

1. Go to the [Ads Manager](https://ads.roblox.com) portal while signed in to your Roblox account and select the **CREATE AD ACCOUNT** button.
2. Choose between a **Personal** or **Business** ad account. A personal account is for individuals who wish to advertise on Roblox, while a business account manages a company's ad presence on Roblox.
3. Check the box to confirm the provided information and click the **CREATE AD ACCOUNT** button. You'll receive a welcome letter at your verified email address confirming your account creation.

## Add a payment method

Before you can create and manage ads on Roblox, you first need to provide a payment method. To add a payment method to your ad account:

1. Navigate to **Payment Settings** in the Ads Manager.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Menu-Payment-Settings.png" width="258" />

2. There are two payment methods available for selection:
   1. **Credit or Debit Card:** Credit or debit cards are available for users 18 and above. A temporary $1.00 USD hold will be placed on the card and refunded after verification is complete within 7 business days.
   2. **Robux Ad Credit:** Converting Robux into ad credits to fund your campaigns is available for all users 13 and up.

### Convert Robux to ad credits

Any Roblox user aged 13 and above can convert Robux to ad credit and utilize it for running ads. This accessibility ensures that a wide range of creators can participate in the advertising ecosystem.

Advertisers can specify the amount of ad credit they wish to purchase. When converting Robux to ad credits, consider the following:

- 1 ad credit is equivalent to 285 Robux.
- 10 ad credits is the minimum conversion requirement.

This minimum conversation requirement streamlines the conversion process, prevents inaccuracies, and ensures that your ad credit balance is sufficient to support meaningful advertising campaigns.

<img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Ad-Credits.png" width="780" />

<Alert severity="warning">
   Converting Robux to ad credit is a permanent and irreversible action. Once you convert Robux to ad credits they can only be spent on campaigns within the Ads Manager.
</Alert>

## Create ad campaigns

An **ad campaign** is a coordinated series of ads designed to achieve a specific goal. To create an ad campaign, you must do the following:

1. [Define the ad campaign](#define-the-campaign): Campaigns are defined by their campaign objectives, budget, and duration.
2. [Define ad sets](#define-ad-sets): An ad set is a group of ads within a campaign that shares the same targeting and bidding parameters.
3. [Create ads](#create-ads): Ads are the individual ads shown to players.

Before launching your campaign, you'll be able to [review your campaign details](#review-the-campaign) before submitting it to Roblox for moderation and approval.

<Alert severity="warning">
   Advertising paid experiences and restricted (17+) experiences is only available with sponsored and search ads.
</Alert>

### Define the campaign

Campaigns are defined by their **campaign objective** and **budgeting and scheduling** parameters.

Campaign objectives are divided into three categories:

- **Awareness**: Campaigns focused on awareness show image or autoplaying video ads to increase awareness of your brand within an experience.
- **Visits**: Campaigns focused on visits aim to attract people to your experience on Roblox. These can take the form of either **immersive ads** placed within portal ad units in publisher experiences, or as **sponsored experiences** on the Home page. Advertisers are not able to promote their 17+ experiences using the **Visits** objective.
- **Video Views**: Campaigns focused on 15-second click-to-play video views to engage audiences in-experience.

Budgeting and scheduling parameters control campaign spending and duration. There are two different types of budgets:

- **Daily budgets:** A daily budget is the maximum amount you'll pay for your ads per day.
- **Lifetime budgets:** A lifetime budget is the maximum amount you'll pay for your ads for the duration of the campaign.

You cannot set both a daily and lifetime budget. Budgets are paid by either your credit card on file or existing ad credit balance.

To set up an ad campaign:

1. Navigate to the **Manage Ads** tab in the Ads Manager and click the **CREATE** button. The **Campaign** window displays.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Campaign-Create.png" width="780" />

2. Select your **Payment Method**. If using ad credits, ensure the campaign budget does not exceed the available ad credits within your account. Ad credits will be debited upon campaign submission based on your set budget.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/campaign-payment-method.png" width="780" />

3. Determine the **Campaign Objective** by selecting it in the dropdown.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Campaign-Objective.png" width="780" />

4. Determine the **Daily Budget** or **Lifetime Budget** for your campaign. You cannot set both a daily and lifetime budget.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Campaign-Budget-Schedule.png" width="780" />

5. Determine the length of your campaign by selecting the **End Date** field.

   - End dates are optional when using daily budgets for debit and credit cards. If an end date is not set, campaign will run indefinitely using the daily budget.
   - End dates are required for ad credit funded campaigns.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Campaign-Set-End-Date.png" width="780" />

6. Name your campaign and click the **NEXT** button.
   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Campaign-Name-Next.png" width="780" />

### Define ad sets

Ad sets are a group of ads within a campaign that share the same targeting and bidding parameters. When defining an ad set, you can customize your ad campaigns according to the following areas:

- **Audience settings** - Choose who sees your ad according to their geographical location, gender, age, and what device they're playing on.
- **Ad placement** - Determine where your ads are discoverable on the platform, such as in search results or within experiences.
- **Brand Suitability** - Filter what kinds of experiences your ads are served in according to the content within the experiences.

By adjusting all three categories, you can control who sees your ad to meet the needs of your respective campaign goals. To define an ad set:

1. Determine up to 10 regions or countries you want your ad to appear in. When you target a region, you automatically target every country within that region.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Ad-Set-Locations.png" width="780" />

2. Determine the gender and age range of the players you wish to see your ads, as well as which devices you'd like your ads to appear on. Certain options may not be available in some locations.
   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Ad-Set-Gender-Ages-Devices.png" width="780" />

3. Select where you want to place your ads according to your campaign objective.

   - Advertisers with a **visits campaign objective** can choose between an in-experience portal within an experience or a sponsored experience on the Home page.
   - Advertisers with an **awareness campaign objective** can choose between an in-experience video or image.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Ad-Placement.png" width="780" />

4. Select an inventory tier according to the kinds of experiences you want to serve your ads. Inventory tiers only affect which experiences that ads can appear in, **not** who can see an ad. For example, if an advertiser chooses Standard Inventory, their ads may be shown in an experience with a 9+ age recommendation to audiences who are 13+.

   <table>
   <thead>
     <tr>
       <th>Brand suitability tiers</th>
       <th>Experiences with content maturity labels eligible to serve ads</th>
       <th>Age of users eligible to see ads</th>
     </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
     <tr>
       <td>**Full Inventory**</td>
       <td>Minimal, mild, moderate, restricted</td>
       <td>13+, except in 17+ experiences where users must be 17+ and ID-verified</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>**Standard Inventory**</td>
       <td>Minimal, mild</td>
       <td>Users age 13+</td>
     </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>**Limited Inventory**</td>
       <td>Minimal</td>
       <td>Users age 13+</td>
     </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>

   <Alert severity="warning">

   Selecting **Standard Inventory** or **Limited Inventory** will exclude experiences with more mature content but may limit your reach. Regardless of what option you select, your ads will not be shown to users under the age of 13 or in experiences that do not comply with the Roblox community standards. For more information, see the [advertising standards](./comply-with-advertising-standards.md) and the [brand suitability tables](#brand-suitability-tables).

   </Alert>

   For a breakdown of what types of content you can expect for each [content maturity](content-maturity.md) label, reference the following table:

   <table>
   <thead>
     <tr>
       <th>Maturity label</th>
       <th>Description</th>
     </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
     <tr>
       <td>**Minimal**</td>
       <td>May contain occasional mild violence and/or light unrealistic blood.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>**Mild**</td>
       <td>May contain repeated mild violence, heavy unrealistic blood, mild fear-based content, and/or mild crude humor.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>**Moderate**</td>
       <td>May contain moderate violence, light realistic blood, moderate fear-based content, moderate crude humor, and/or unplayable gambling content.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>**Restricted**</td>
       <td>May contain strong violence, heavy realistic blood, moderate crude humor, romantic themes, unplayable gambling content, the presence of alcohol, and/or strong language.</td>
     </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>

5. Choose which [genres](#genre-targeting) you want to target with your ads.

   - For sponsored experiences, this represents the genre interests of your audience.
   - For immersive ads, this represents the genre of the experiences your ads will display in.

6. Determine your max bid price to show your ads to players through the available ad units placed in experiences. Bids are reflected as CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions) meaning that your max bid for CPM is the maximum amount you're willing to pay every thousand impressions. For more information about Roblox's bidding system, see [Bidding and auction](#bidding-and-auction).

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Ad-Set-Bidding.png" width="900" />

7. Name your ad set, then click the **NEXT** button.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Ad-Set-Name-Next.png" width="780" />

To maximize your advertising reach and use both in-experience portals and sponsored experiences within the same campaign, consider creating an additional ad set. This flexibility enables you to experiment with different ad strategies and optimize your campaign's performance.

<Alert severity="info">

When you define your ad set, an audience estimation displays that indicates how many Roblox user accounts your ads can reach over a month when applying your targeting parameters and placements. It estimates a maximum number of users on the platform who may be exposed to your ads, and does not take into consideration your budget limits or bidding parameters.

</Alert>

#### Brand suitability tables

The following tables show what types of content you can expect to appear alongside your immersive ads depending on your brand suitability inventory selection.

While context exclusions are done as effectively as possible, complete accuracy is not guaranteed. Brand Suitability controls only affect which experiences ads are shown in and not the age of who sees an ad. Regardless of what Brand Suitability options you choose, your ads will only be shown to 13+ users. Content types listed within the brand suitability guidelines are thematic examples and are not guaranteed to appear within each inventory tier.

For more information on content exclusions associated with content maturity, see [Content maturity](content-maturity.md) and [Content maturity labels](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8862768451604-Experience-Guidelines-and-Age-Recommendations).

<br />
<h5>Always excluded content</h5>

To support brand safety, all content on Roblox must continue to abide by the [community standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards). The Roblox Community Standards set a high bar for content that is safe and civil for the platform.

For example, this content is not allowed on the platform in any context:

- Extreme violence including real-world depictions of graphic violence, war crimes, or terrorism
- Depiction of real-world sensitive events
- Depiction of sexual acts or nudity
- Hate speech or promotion of hate groups
- Discussion or depiction of use of illegal drugs or regulated substances including tobacco, vaping, and steroids
- Discussion or depiction of political content including political parties, political candidates, and elected officials

#### Bidding and auction

Ads on Roblox work in a bidding system, where advertisers bid to have their ads shown to users through the available ad units placed in an experience. When determining your bidding settings, bids are reflected as CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions). Your max bid for CPM is the maximum amount you're willing to pay every thousand times your ad is seen by the user. A higher CPM can increase the chances of winning the auction, but it also means you'll pay more.

Coinciding with this, Roblox runs an auction to determine the best ad to show when there is an ad opportunity. Advertisers set the maximum price they are willing to pay as CPM or CPP (cost per play). Roblox considers the player and ad information to generate an eCPM (effective cost per thousand impressions) value for each ad in the request.

All eligible ads participate in a **second price auction**. The ad with the highest bid wins the ad slot, but only charges the price of the second highest price, plus one cent. In principle, this looks like:

1. Advertisers submit their bids for ad space.
2. Roblox calculates the eCPM value for each ad based on the player and ad information.
3. The ads are then placed into an auction.
4. The ad with the highest eCPM value wins the auction.
5. The winning ad is then displayed to the player.
6. The advertiser is charged its bid amount of the second highest price, plus one cent ($0.01).

As an example:

1. An advertiser wants to display their ad on a website.
2. The advertiser submits a bid of $10.
3. Another advertiser submits a bid of $12.

The second advertiser wins the auction and is charged $10.01, the price of the second highest bid, plus one cent.

#### Genre targeting

Genre targeting helps you target your ads to reach people who are more likely to engage with your experience.

You can target particular genres with your ad sets. Note that these are Roblox's genre classifications and may not be the same as the genre categories self-declared by developers.

<br />
<h5>Experience genre</h5>

When buying [immersive ads](../../production/monetization/immersive-ads.md), which are ads within experiences, experience genres are based on the genre of the experiences your ads will be served in. For instance, if you select only "Roleplaying," your ads will only appear in experiences classified as "Roleplaying."<br />

<br />
<h5>Audience genre</h5>

For **sponsored experiences**, audience genre targeting is based on users' preferences. Ads will only be served to users who like to play experiences in the selected genres.

There are nine genres available for targeting:

- **Action** - Emphasizes physical challenges that require motor skills such as jumping, shooting, and climbing.
- **Adventure** - Complete tasks by using clues and interacting with people or the environment to progress gameplay.
- **Obby** - Requires players to navigate a series of challenging obstacles to reach a goal or complete a task.
- **Roleplaying** - Players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting and have freedom to influence the story.
- **Simulation** - Experiences that closely simulate real world or fictional realities.
- **Social** - Enables an environment where characters can meet friends, hangout, and socialize.
- **Sports** - Emulates the playing of traditional or fictional physical sports.
- **Strategy** - Focuses on skillful thinking and planning to achieve success.
- **Tycoon** - Players take on the role of a business owner and manage various aspects of the business to achieve success and profitability.

<Alert severity="warning">
Audience genre targeting isn't available when buying sponsored experiences to reach audiences in the EU.
</Alert>

### Create ads

You can create three different types of ads using the Ads Manager:

- [Sponsored experiences](#sponsored-experiences) appear as sponsored experience tiles on the Home page.
- [Portal ads](#portal-ads) are static, non-clickable images within the 3D space of an experience, with a door that teleports a player into an advertiser's experience.
- [Image ads](#image-ads) are static, non-clickable images within the 3D space of an experience.
- [Video ads](#video-ads) are either auto-playing (non-rewarded) or click-to-play (can be rewarded) videos within the 3D space of an experience.
- [Search ads](#search-ads) allow you to promote your experience to users ages 13+ who are actively searching for experiences or genres of experiences using specific keywords.

The **ad type** is determined by your [campaign objective](#define-the-campaign). Campaign objectives valuing **awareness** are displayed as image ads, while campaign objectives valuing **visits** are displayed as tile and portal ads.

Roblox reviews each submitted ad prior to it being run. Ensure your ad is eligible to run by following the [advertising standards](./comply-with-advertising-standards.md).

#### Sponsored experiences

You can create a sponsored experience for All Ages, 9+ and 13+ experiences by choosing "visits" Campaign Objective. Currently, you may not run sponsored experiences for 17+ experiences.

After selecting and uploading an image or video file, click **Live Preview** next to the image or video thumbnail. This takes you to a demo experience created by Roblox to teach users how to build and advertise on the Roblox platform. Inside the experience, you can see and interact with the ad format you selected in Ads Manager.

<img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Live-Preview-Experience.png" width="780" />

<Alert severity="info">
After you upload an image or video file, that file is submitted to Roblox for moderator approval. If approval is pending, a watermark displays on top of the live preview of your ad inside the demo experience. If Roblox rejects your file, the live preview of your ad doesn't show up inside the demo experience.
</Alert>

### Review the campaign

With your ad campaign, ad set, and individual ad created, it's time to review your selections. This final screen enables you to revisit any previous setting of your campaign and is required for review before launch. Once submitted, your ad is reviewed by moderators for approval.

<Alert severity="info">
Roblox tries to complete moderation within 24 hours for each ad submitted. Ads that do not pass moderation show the status of rejected.
</Alert>

To review your ad campaign:

1. Click the **EDIT CAMPAIGN** button to make changes to the campaign settings.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Review-Campaign.png" width="780" />

4. When you finish reviewing, click the **SUBMIT** button.

### Edit a campaign

Once a campaign, ad set, or ad is submitted, an advertiser can make adjustments to certain parameters. To determine which parameters are changeable, consult the following table:

| **Changeable**               | **Fixed**                   |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Campaign name                | Campaign objective          |
| Campaign end and start dates | Campaign budget type        |
| Campaign budget amount       | Ad set bid type             |
| Ad set bid amount            | Ad set targeting parameters |
| Ad set name                  |                             |
| Ad name                      |                             |
| Ad type                      |                             |

### Cancel a campaign

If an advertiser wishes to retract a campaign for any reason, they have the option to cancel the campaign up to six hours before its scheduled start time. Cancellation is accessible at the campaign level and automatically cancels any associated ad sets and ads. This feature is available for campaigns with any payment method, and enables advertisers to recover their ad credits or prevent their credit or debit card from being charged.

You can't transfer ad credits associated with a specific campaign to another campaign. When a campaign is cancelled, Roblox applies the campaign's ad credits back to the account.
